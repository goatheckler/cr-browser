# Feature Specification: Owner Image Browser

**Feature Branch**: `003-owner-image-browser`  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User request to add "Browse Images" button that shows all images published by an owner across all supported registries (GHCR, Docker Hub, Quay, GCR) with simplified columns showing only Owner/Image.

## Execution Flow (main)
‚úÖ All steps completed successfully

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a container registry user, I want to browse all images published by a specific owner/organization across different registries, so that I can discover available images without knowing their exact names beforehand.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am viewing the registry browser with "Docker Hub" selected and "library" as owner, **When** I click the "Browse Images" button, **Then** I see a list of all public images published by the "library" namespace

2. **Given** I am viewing the registry browser with "Quay.io" selected and "coreos" as owner, **When** I click the "Browse Images" button, **Then** I see a list of all public images published by the "coreos" namespace

3. **Given** I am viewing the registry browser with "GHCR" selected and a valid owner name, **When** I click the "Browse Images" button, **Then** the system prompts me to provide a GitHub Personal Access Token

4. **Given** I have provided a valid GitHub PAT for GHCR, **When** I browse images, **Then** I see all container packages published by that GitHub user/organization

5. **Given** I am viewing the registry browser with "GCR" selected, **When** I enter a value in the owner field, **Then** the system indicates this should be a GCP Project ID, not a username

6. **Given** I am viewing a list of images, **When** I click on a specific image, **Then** the main form is populated with that owner/image combination and the tag list is automatically fetched

7. **Given** I am viewing a list of 100+ images, **When** I scroll to the bottom, **Then** the next page of results is automatically loaded (for registries with pagination)

8. **Given** I have browsed images and selected one, **When** I close the browse dialog, **Then** the selected image information persists in the main form

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an owner has no published images? ‚Üí Display "No images found for this owner"
- How does the system handle network errors during image browsing? ‚Üí Show error message with retry option
- What happens when a GitHub PAT is invalid or expired for GHCR? ‚Üí Clear error message directing user to generate new token
- How does the system handle registries with different authentication requirements? ‚Üí Registry-specific prompts and help text
- What happens when a GCR user enters a username instead of project ID? ‚Üí Show helpful error explaining GCR's project-based model
- How does the system handle rate limiting from registry APIs? ‚Üí Display rate limit message with countdown/retry guidance

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Browsing Functionality
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a "Browse Images" action that allows users to discover images without knowing exact image names
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a list of images showing Owner and Image Name columns
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to select an image from the browse list to populate the main tag viewer form
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically fetch tags when an image is selected from the browse list

#### Registry-Specific Requirements

##### Docker Hub
- **FR-005**: System MUST support browsing public images on Docker Hub without requiring authentication
- **FR-006**: System MUST display Docker Hub-specific metadata (description, star count, pull count) when available

##### Quay.io
- **FR-007**: System MUST support browsing public images on Quay.io without requiring authentication
- **FR-008**: System MUST display Quay.io-specific metadata (description, repository state) when available

##### GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- **FR-009**: System MUST prompt users to provide a GitHub Personal Access Token when browsing GHCR images
- **FR-010**: System MUST securely store the GitHub PAT for the duration of the browsing session
- **FR-011**: System MUST clearly communicate that the GitHub PAT requires "read:packages" scope
- **FR-012**: System MUST differentiate between GHCR registry authentication (for tags) and GitHub API authentication (for package listing)
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide help text or link to GitHub PAT creation documentation

##### Google Container Registry (GCR)
- **FR-014**: System MUST indicate to users that GCR requires a GCP Project ID instead of a username/owner
- **FR-015**: System MUST adjust the input field label from "Owner" to "Project ID" when GCR is selected
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide help text explaining GCR's project-based organization model

#### User Experience
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide visual feedback when the browse operation is in progress (loading indicator)
- **FR-018**: System MUST handle pagination for registries that return large numbers of images
- **FR-019**: System MUST display appropriate error messages when an owner/project has no images
- **FR-020**: System MUST allow users to search/filter within the browsed image list
- **FR-021**: System MUST display the last updated timestamp for each image when available
- **FR-022**: System MUST provide a way to close/cancel the browse dialog without selecting an image

#### Error Handling
- **FR-023**: System MUST display clear error messages when network requests fail
- **FR-024**: System MUST handle and display registry-specific error responses (404 for unknown owner, 401 for auth failures)
- **FR-025**: System MUST handle and display API rate limiting messages with guidance
- **FR-026**: System MUST validate GitHub PAT format before making API requests
- **FR-027**: System MUST clear invalid/expired tokens and re-prompt the user

#### Security & Privacy
- **FR-028**: System MUST only store GitHub PAT in browser session/local storage with HTTPS enforcement
- **FR-029**: System MUST allow users to clear/revoke stored GitHub PAT
- **FR-030**: System MUST not transmit GitHub PAT to the backend server
- **FR-031**: System MUST not log or persist tokens in any permanent storage

### Key Entities
