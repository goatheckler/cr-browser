## Overview

Expand the existing GHCR-only tag browser to support browsing container images from multiple popular container registries. Users should be able to select a registry type before performing their tag lookup, enabling the same convenient tag browsing experience across Docker Hub, Quay.io, Google Container Registry, and other OCI-compliant registries.

**Primary Value**: Developers and DevOps teams often work with container images hosted across multiple registries. Consolidating tag browsing into a single interface eliminates the need to navigate multiple registry-specific web UIs and provides a consistent experience.

**Scope**: Add registry type selection to the existing tag browsing workflow. Support at minimum 3 registries initially (GHCR, Docker Hub, Quay.io) with the ability to add more registries over time.

**Out of Scope for Initial Release**:
- Automatic registry detection from image URL
- Multi-registry search (searching across all registries simultaneously)
- Private registry authentication with custom credentials
- Registry health monitoring or status displays
- Cross-registry image comparison

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A DevOps engineer needs to check available tags for a container image. Sometimes the image is on GitHub Container Registry, sometimes on Docker Hub, and sometimes on Quay.io. Instead of visiting three different websites, they want to use a single tool where they select the registry, enter the image reference, and see all available tags with copy functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user selects "Docker Hub" as the registry and enters `library/nginx`, **When** they trigger lookup, **Then** all tags for the official nginx image on Docker Hub are displayed.

2. **Given** a user selects "Quay.io" as the registry and enters `prometheus/prometheus`, **When** they trigger lookup, **Then** all tags for the Prometheus image on Quay.io are displayed.

3. **Given** a user selects "GHCR" as the registry and enters `microsoft/dotnet-samples`, **When** they trigger lookup, **Then** all tags are displayed (existing behavior preserved).

4. **Given** a user has the page bookmarked with a GHCR query, **When** they visit the old URL without registry selection, **Then** the system defaults to GHCR and displays results (backward compatibility).

5. **Given** a user selects "Docker Hub" and copies a tag reference, **When** the copy completes, **Then** the clipboard contains the properly formatted Docker Hub reference (e.g., `docker.io/library/nginx:latest`).

6. **Given** a user selects an unsupported registry type, **When** they attempt lookup, **Then** a clear error message indicates the registry is not yet supported.

7. **Given** a user performs a lookup on Docker Hub, **When** the repository is not found, **Then** a registry-appropriate not-found error is displayed.

8. **Given** the registry selector is displayed, **When** a user navigates with keyboard only, **Then** they can select a registry and trigger search without using a mouse.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user bookmarks a URL with a specific registry parameter? (Should preserve and honor the parameter)
- How does the system handle registry-specific repository path formats? (e.g., Docker Hub's `library/` prefix for official images)
- What happens if a registry becomes temporarily unavailable? (Show transient error, allow retry)
- How does the system behave when no registry is selected? (Default to GHCR for backward compatibility)

### Measurable Success Criteria

- Successful lookups complete in ‚â§2 seconds regardless of selected registry (95th percentile)
- Registry selection persists in URL query parameters for bookmarking/sharing
- Zero breaking changes to existing GHCR functionality (all existing tests pass)
- Copy functionality generates correctly formatted registry-specific image references
- At least 3 registries supported at initial release

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Core Multi-Registry Support**
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to select a container registry type before performing a tag lookup
- **FR-002**: System MUST support at minimum GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), Docker Hub, and Quay.io
- **FR-003**: System MUST display available registry options in an accessible selector (dropdown, radio group, or similar)
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve the selected registry in the URL query parameters for bookmarking and sharing

**Backward Compatibility**
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain existing GHCR lookup functionality without any breaking changes
- **FR-006**: System MUST default to GHCR when no registry is explicitly selected (preserves existing behavior)
- **FR-007**: System MUST support existing bookmarked URLs and routes that assume GHCR

**Registry-Specific Behavior**
- **FR-008**: System MUST format repository paths according to registry-specific conventions (e.g., Docker Hub `library/` prefix for official images)
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate correctly formatted copy-to-clipboard references specific to each registry (e.g., `docker.io/library/nginx:tag` for Docker Hub)
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate repository references according to registry-specific rules

**Error Handling**
- **FR-011**: System MUST display clear error messages when an unsupported registry is selected
- **FR-012**: System MUST distinguish between not-found errors, invalid format errors, and transient errors for each registry
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide registry-specific error messaging where appropriate

**Performance & Reliability**
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain ‚â§2 second response time for tag lookups across all supported registries (95th percentile)
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle registry-specific rate limiting appropriately
- **FR-016**: System MUST allow users to retry failed requests

**Accessibility & Usability**
- **FR-017**: Registry selector MUST be keyboard accessible and navigable via Tab key
- **FR-018**: Registry selector MUST include appropriate ARIA labels for screen readers
- **FR-019**: System MUST visually indicate which registry is currently selected
- **FR-020**: System MUST preserve registry selection when navigating back to the page

**Future Extensibility**
- **FR-021**: System MUST be architected to allow adding new registries without modifying existing registry implementations
- **FR-022**: System MUST support configuration of registry endpoints via environment variables or configuration files

### Key Entities

- **Registry Type**: Identifier for a specific container registry (e.g., GHCR, DockerHub, Quay). Defines the base URL and authentication requirements.
- **Repository Reference**: Owner and image name in a registry-specific format (may vary between registries)
- **Tag Reference**: Complete image reference including registry prefix, owner, image, and tag (e.g., `ghcr.io/owner/image:tag`)
- **Registry Configuration**: Base URL, token endpoint, and format conventions for a specific registry type

---

## Assumptions & Dependencies

### Assumptions
- All target registries implement the OCI Distribution Specification for tag listing
- Public image browsing does not require user authentication (anonymous or token-based auth sufficient)
- Users understand basic container registry concepts (registry, repository, tag)
- Existing GHCR functionality is working correctly and has test coverage

### Dependencies
- Existing GHCR tag browsing feature (spec 001-ghcr-browser-is) must be complete
- Container registries must provide publicly accessible anonymous or token-based authentication for public images

### Constraints
- Initial release supports only public repositories (no custom credential authentication)
- Response time target of ‚â§2 seconds assumes reasonable network conditions
- Registry API availability is outside system control (dependent on third-party services)

## Future Enhancements (Deferred)

**Extended Registry Support**
- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Harbor (self-hosted)
- JFrog Artifactory
- Google Artifact Registry

**Advanced Features**
- Auto-detect registry from full image URL (parse `quay.io/org/image:tag` automatically)
- Multi-registry search (search the same image across all registries simultaneously)
- Private registry support with custom authentication
- Registry health/status indicators
- Cross-registry image comparison (compare tag availability across registries)

**Operational Enhancements**
- Per-registry rate limit display
- Registry-specific metadata enrichment (size, age, etc.)
- Registry response time monitoring
- Custom private registry configuration UI
